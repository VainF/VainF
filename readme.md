My name is Gongfan Fang, currently a last-year Ph.D. Candidate at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/xml-nus">xML Lab</a> @ National University of Singapore, under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/"> <b> Prof. Xinchao Wang (Presidential Young Professor) </b> </a>. Before joining xML Lab, I earned my Bachelor’s degree in 2019 and completed my Master’s degree in 2022 at the <a href="https://www.vipazoo.cn/">Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab</a> @ Zhejiang University, advised by <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong"> <b>Prof. Mingli Song</b></a>. </p>

My research focuses on <strong>LLMs, Diffusion and Efficient Generative Models</strong>. My previous work includes Hybrid Reasoning LLM, Efficient LLM, and Fast Diffusion Transformers. I'm also actively contributing to several projects such as <strong><a href="https://github.com/VainF/Torch-Pruning">Torch-Pruning</a></strong>, a top framework for compressing foundation models.
