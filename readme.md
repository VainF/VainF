Hello there! My name is Gongfan Fang, and I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the Learning and Vision (LV) Lab at the National University of Singapore, advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/sitexinchaowang/">Xinchao Wang</a>. Prior to joining LV Lab, I completed my Bachelor's degree in 2019 and Master's degree in 2022 at the Visual Intelligence and Pattern Analysis (VIPA) Lab at Zhejiang University, where I worked under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/msong">Mingli Song</a>. My research interests primarily revolve around developing algorithms for efficient deep learning and model compression. I am particularly interested in exploring how these methods can be applied to real-world problems.
